    "**Introduction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for earth-like planets in our galaxy, scientists are able to determine a planet’s radius, the planetary radius, and distance from its sun, also known as the orbital radius (Jones et al, 2008; Otegi et al, 2020). These two characteristics help determine the composition and density of planets and, ultimately, whether or not a planet is habitable. NASA states that a potentially habitable planet is a planet that can sustain life for a significant period, requiring water, energy and nutrients, although this definition of a habitable planet changes as new discoveries are made (NASA, 2023). The size of a planet is critical for habitability because it must have enough gravity to hold water on its surface (Jones, 2008). The distance from a sun is also indicative of habitability as this relates to temperature, which in turn affects if water can exist on the surface in liquid form (Jones, 2008). The distance in which water can exist on the planet is known as the habitable zone (NASA, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "When scientists identify a new exoplanet - a planet that is found outside of our solar system - they typically classify it as either Neptune-like, Gas-Giant, Super Earth, Terrestrial or Unknown. The type of planet can be indicative of habitability as well. Gaseous planets, like Gas-Giants, are considered uninhabitable because, while they may have a core of rock or metal, the surface is under extreme pressure from the rest of the planet and they lack a solid surface to stand on (Papiewski, 2019). Super-Earths may be rocky, but often lack atmospheres, making them also uninhabitable (NASA, 2023). On the other hand, terrestrial planets, like our own, have in the past been found to be the right size and distance from a sun to support water. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we are attempting to look at the planet’s radius and orbital radius from their sun in order to classify it into one of the following categories: Neptune-like, Gas-Giant, Super Earth, Terrestrial and Unknown. This will help us answer the question: Given orbital radius and planetary radius, can we accurately classify exoplanets? Answering this question can help screen planets so that only terrestrial planets are investigated for habitability in the future. To address this question, we will be using the dataset “NASA Exoplanets” obtained from the website Kaggle. This dataset contains a comprehensive archive of all of the planets outside of our solar system, known as exoplanets, that NASA has discovered. It includes information on each planet’s name, brightness, year of discovery, distance from Earth, orbital radius, radius, mass and planet type."

    "\n",
    "Certain variables in the data had information split up between two columns, including the radius of the planet, which we planned to use in our analysis. Specifically, information about the radius was stored in the column radius_wrt, with the name of a planet in our solar system that the given planet could be compared to, and radius_multiplier, which contained a multiplier of the planet in radius_wrt. To convert the data into a format that we could use for our analysis, we had to combine the information from these two columns, to produce a single radius value. Planets differed in what they were measured with respect to (Earth vs Jupiter). To standardize radii, we created a column called radius_wrt_num. For all planets in which radius_wrt was Earth, the value of this column was set to 1  and for all those with Jupiter, this value was 11.2. As the size of Jupiter is approximately 11.2 times greater than Earth, this change allowed us to then compute all of the radii relative to Earth by multiplying the radius_wrt_num column by the radius_multiplier column. This new value was stored in a new column called  planetary_radius_prop and radius_wrt_num was removed from the data set. \n",

First,  we made a recipe to scale and center the data, as the scale of the orbital radius was at a much greater magnitude than the planetary radius. Next, we determined the k value that would yield the highest accuracy by making 5 folds in the data using the vfold_cv function and creating a workflow with resampling. After running the data through workflow, we plotted the accuracy that was obtained from this cross-validation. When accuracy was graphed, it appeared relatively consistent across several k values, however, k = 5 was the highest. \n",

    "**Discussion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of analyzing our classification model through the comparison of accuracy between testing (true) labels and the predictions, we found that our classifier has a 96.2% classification accuracy. In other words, 96 of 100 planets were correctly classified by our model. Due to the high classifier accuracy statistic, we can comfortably state that exoplanets can be classified into their respective planet types given orbital radius and planetary radius. However, just classifying the planet type using these factors may not be as effective as using more factors. For example, it could be more accurate if the mass of the planet was taken into account as rocky planet types like terrestrial or super-earth are probably more likely to have a higher mass. Furthermore, our estimates are limited to the data from our data set. There will be outliers that do not fit the patterns of the data that our classifier would predict incorrectly. Investigating the influences of other factors like the mass of the planet would be the next step in future classifying models. However, with a 96.2% prediction accuracy, this model is very effective.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We expected our findings to reflect that smaller planetary radii and orbital radii are rocky planet types and planets with larger planetary radii and orbital radii are gaseous planet types, where both variables hold relatively equal influence. Our classifier accuracy of 96.2% combined with the visualization of results supported our expected findings regarding the relationship between planetary and orbital radii and planet types. However, we discovered that planetary radii have a more significant influence on planet type than orbital radii, as depicted in our “Analysis Plot”, where horizontal lines can be seen to separate the various planet types. We also expected there to be some grey areas when planetary or orbital radii are neither large nor small. The error of 3.8% has supported our expectations in terms of incorrect classification of planet types due to indistinct statistics. After review, supported by statistics displayed in the confusion matrix, it appears that our model has a relatively weak understanding of Neptune-like planet types. To elaborate, when looking at the confusion matrix most cases of misclassification were where non-Neptune-like planets were classified as Neptune-like planets. This was especially the case with Super Earth and Gas Giant planet types, where 15 Gas Giants and 19 Super-Earths were classified by our model as Neptune-like planets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying terrestrial planets with composition and gravity similar to that of Earth’s could be impactful as it could lead to discoveries of life in other areas of our galaxy. If other planets are similar to Earth, it is reasonable to explore the possibility that the conditions that lead to life here could also lead to life elsewhere.\n",
    "Using this confirmed relation between orbital radius, planetary radius, and planet type, we could simplify planet classification to accelerate the discovery of planets of certain types. For example, if you wanted to specifically look for a Super-Earth, the relationship proved by our classifier would allow for the assumption that only planets with smaller orbital and planetary radii should be examined. This saving on costs and analysis time would allow for a deeper examination of other variables or traits of the determined planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the classification error, a future question could be what other predictor variable has a significant influence on planet types; when orbital and planetary radii are constant, what variables contribute to classifying a planet? As stated earlier in the discussion, a potential predictor variable that could help make the classification more accurate is the mass of the planet, but this would need to be confirmed by future studies. \n",
    "Some further questions we could ask is if the planet is habitable. We determined what type of planet it is and from there we could further narrow down to its habitability. Another question this could lead to is if this planet could be colonized by humans - how far away is it from Earth? This could result in some interesting discoveries that could lead humans to colonize planets that are already habitable across galaxies in the future instead of trying to make uninhabitable planets habitable like Mars."
